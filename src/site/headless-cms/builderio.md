## Builder.io

Go from idea to production with unprecedented efficiency

Builder is driving the next generation of front-end programming, with the only [Visual Development Platform](https://www.builder.io/visual-development-platform) that offers an AI-powered design-to-code tool, a visual editor, and an enterprise CMS.

### How to get started

- Use [Builder Devtools](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/devtools) or in the root of your project run `npm init builder.io@latest`
- Integrate the [Builder API or SDK](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/api-intro) to your site or app
- Create a free account on [builder.io](https://builder.io) and drag and drop to create and publish pages and content

### What is it good for?

- [Headless CMS](https://www.builder.io/headless-cms) provides a centralized hub for structuring, managing, governing, and distributing content to any front-end, for any use case.
- [Visual Editor](https://www.builder.io/visual-editor) lets marketers use their engineer's code components and our AI-enabled no-code editing capabilities to build complex, high-quality web and mobile experiences.
- [Visual Copilot](https://www.builder.io/m/design-to-code) turn days into minutes by bringing AI into your design-to-code workflow. Convert Figma designs into clean code with one click. 
- [Design systems](https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder/tree/master/examples/react-design-system) and visually editing your custom components
- Marketing & content pages (Homepage, promotions, merchandising, about, FAQ, help, docs, etc)
- Marketing content across pages (promotional sections, overlays, etc)

### Who is it good for?
- Marketing teams with ever-changing needs that templates can't keep up with
- Developers who are tired of marketing requests and pushing pixels
- Designers who need to implement pixel-perfect designs while respecting your existing components.
