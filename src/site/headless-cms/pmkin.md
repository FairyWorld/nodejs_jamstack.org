# About PMKIN

At PMKIN, our mission is to create a content management system that's as powerful and easy to use. Too many teams struggle with complex CMSs that frustrate writers and developers alike. That's why we built PMKIN—a headless CMS designed from the ground up to simplify content creation and delivery for modern JAMstack sites.

## Why PMKIN?

Our intuitive editor streamlines the writing, formatting, and publishing experience for non-technical team members. No more fighting with complex markup or technical setups—focus on creating great content.

PMKIN gives your marketing, editorial, and subject matter experts the power of content management. Our user-friendly interface allows them to work independently, freeing up your development team to focus on building unique experiences.

With PMKIN's headless architecture, your content is decoupled from your front end, allowing you to publish updates quickly without waiting for developer bandwidth. Our GraphQL API makes it easy to integrate content into your JAMstack applications.

PMKIN is designed to work seamlessly with your JAMstack tech stack, especially Next.js. Our API-first approach and developer-friendly tools make connecting your content to your application simple.

## How PMKIN Works

PMKIN provides a comprehensive set of features to streamline your content management workflow:

- Our intuitive editor lets content creators focus on the writing experience without learning complex markup languages. Format text, add images, and build engaging content without technical constraints.

- Publish your content immediately or schedule future updates. PMKIN's SEO-friendly features ensure your content is optimized for search engines as soon as it goes live.

- Use categories to keep your content structured and easy to manage. PMKIN's centralized content hub makes finding, updating, and repurposing all your valuable content assets simple.

- PMKIN stores your content in Markdown format and serves it through a powerful GraphQL API. This allows your development team to efficiently integrate content into your JAMstack applications, with full control over the presentation layer.
