Ata's SSG is a simple static site generator written in PHP which deploys to GitHub Pages by default. It doesn't use frameworks, just uses vanilla PHP and vanilla HTML. It supports both markdown and PHP pages There is a simple blog support through the markdown files. It provides instant previews using the built-in web server. It's incredible simple, very flexible, requires just basic knowledge of PHP and HTML and deploys to free GitHub pages (if your repo is public).
